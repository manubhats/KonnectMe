##Inspiration
A lot of group/event organizing apps are message based so we decided to introduce a new concept by allowing users to RSVP to an event by answering to an automated call.

##What it does
It aids in organizing and receiving feedback on events invites.

##How I built it
We used Android and Nodejs and Tropo
